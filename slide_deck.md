---

## **Slide 5: Architecture Overview (3 minutes)**
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Unique CIDR ranges, node IP connectivity, and shared CA.
  - Load balancers with MetalLB (for on-prem clusters).
- **Architecture Diagram**: Show how clusters are interconnected.
- **Components Used**:
  - RKE2, Helm, ArgoCD, MetalLB, NGINX, and more.

---

## **Slide 6: Global Services (3 minutes)**
- **What are Global Services?**
  - Unified service discovery and load balancing across clusters.
- **Scenarios**:
  - Single AZ, multi-AZ, and multi-region deployments.
  - Improved resiliency, reduced latency, and fault tolerance.
- **How It Works**:
  - eBPF-driven load balancing.
  - DNS-based service discovery across clusters.

---

## **Slide 7: Shared Ingress (2 minutes)**
- **Challenges with Traditional Ingress Controllers**:
  - Endpoint availability issues across clusters.
- **NGINX Ingress with Cilium**:
  - Shared ingress using `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream`.
  - Balances traffic across clusters even without local endpoints.
- **Role of `CiliumEndpoints`**:
  - Enhanced metadata and visibility for optimized traffic routing.

---

## **Slide 8: Lightweight Service Mesh (2 minutes)**
- **Cilium as a Lightweight Service Mesh**:
  - Service mesh-like functionality without sidecar proxies.
- **eBPF vs Traditional Service Mesh**:
  - Lower overhead, kernel-level routing, and security.
- **SPIRE/SPIFFE for Workload Security**:
  - Securing workloads with identities.

---

## **Slide 9: Node Encryption with Wireguard (1 minute)**
- **Wireguard Integration**:
  - Encrypt traffic between nodes.
  - Lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy with Cilium.

---

## **Slide 10: Demo Overview (2 minutes)**
- **Demo Preview**:
  - Deploy Cilium Cluster Mesh across two clusters.
  - Demonstrate global services, shared ingress, and service failover.
- **Key Goals**:
  - Show multi-cluster communication and load balancing in action.
  - Highlight secure communication with Wireguard.

---

# **Demo Outline (20 minutes)**

## **Step 1: Setup Overview (2 minutes)**
- Show the environment setup:
